# SnappAiFi Wealth Platform

SnappAiFi is an innovative financial platform that combines holistic credit scoring, community support networks, and patent tokenization to create a more inclusive and equitable financial ecosystem.

## Core Features

### Holistic Credit Scoring

Our revolutionary credit scoring system goes beyond traditional metrics to consider:

- Family and peer support networks
- Education and career trajectory
- Location stability and frequency
- Financial hardship context, including gentrification
- Traditional credit factors

This approach identifies responsible, reliable individuals who may be overlooked by conventional credit systems.

### Support Collective

The Support Collective enables friends and family to contribute financially to specific user goals:

- Education funding
- Transportation needs
- Housing assistance
- Career advancement
- Milestone celebrations

These contributions not only help users achieve their goals but also strengthen their holistic credit score by demonstrating community support.

### Patent & NFF System

Our patent system helps users:

- Identify new utility patentable variations
- Structure patent submissions with high success rates
- Track the approval process
- Tokenize approved patents as Non-Fungible Funds (NFFs)

### Non-Fungible Fund (NFF)

The NFF concept replaces traditional NFTs with a more dynamic financial instrument:

- Represents a fund attached to an asset
- Acts as a vehicle where tokens can always be added
- Valued at the "gold standard" price per token
- Provides ongoing investment opportunities

## Technical Architecture

The SnappAiFi platform is built using:

- React for the frontend UI
- Chakra UI for component styling
- Next.js for server-side rendering
- RESTful APIs for data exchange
- Blockchain technology for NFF tokenization
